# CENSUS
Counting Interleaved Functional Tenants on Shared Storage.

CENSUS is a novel classification framework that combines time-series analysis with gradient boosting to identify the number of tenants in a storage workload by projecting its trace into a high-dimensional feature representation space. We show that Census can distinguish the number of interleaved workloads in a real world trace segment with up to an average of 90% accuracy.
